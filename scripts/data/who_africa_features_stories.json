        "text_s": "Following the declaration of Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola is stepping up disease surveillance, prevention and preparedness measures especially in the country’s Lunda Norte province which borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo.A multidisciplinary team with experts from the National Directorate of Public Health, the National Institute for Health Research, World Health Organization (WHO), and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), visited  Tchissanda, Fortuna and Nachire border crossings in Lunda Norte to assess and help implement preparedness measures by  local health authorities, as well as raise awareness among  communities about Ebola, its symptoms, early reporting of suspected cases and how to stay safe.The team provided training on key areas such as the Ebola virus disease identification, infection prevention and control, active case finding, diseases surveillance in communities and at points of entry, sample collection and transportation, as well as risk communication, including strategies to address mis- or disinformation.In total, 140 officials, including health professionals, community mobilizers, police officers and border authorities, took part in the trainings.“The Ministry of Health’s priority is to guarantee early detection, appropriate case management, and above all, the protection of both our communities and the health workers in the frontline” says Dr Eusébio Manuel, Head of the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiological Surveillance at Angola’s Ministry of Health. “We are firmly committed to strengthening Angola’s preparedness against Ebola.”In addition, more than 150 traditional and religious leaders, midwives, hunters and traditional healers from five municipalities of Luanda Norte took part in the preparedness activities that also aimed to build community trust and align local response with the municipal outbreak preparedness and action plans to ensure a coordinated and effective response.“Preparing now means saving lives later. Every trained official and every informed community increases Angola's capacity to respond effectively if the virus crosses the border,” says Dr Noémia Silva, WHO surveillance and immunization officer in Lunda Norte province.WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level. WHO is working with the national authorities in 10 priority countries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo to initiate readiness assessments and contingency planning.",

I didn't want to be judged or have people in my neighbourhood talking about me,” says Kadidia, a 19-year-old student in Bamako.Like Kadidia, thousands of young women in Mali face social, cultural and structural barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health services. In 2024, the country recorded 583 maternal deaths, including 89 among adolescents aged 15 to 19. The risks associated with early and unwanted pregnancies remain high. The figures show an improvement, but also the scale of the work that remains to be done: the country had nearly 4.8 million women of reproductive age in 2024 and 559 493 young women and adolescents had access to modern contraceptive methods, compared with 480 682 in 2023.Providing young women with appropriate and accessible reproductive health services is fundamental to their safety and future. By enabling them to make informed choices about their bodies and health, these services help reduce unwanted pregnancies, prevent sexually transmitted infections, and improve their physical and mental well-being. In a context where taboos persist and risks are high, guaranteeing these rights becomes a public health priority.World Health Organization (WHO), with the support of a major donor, is assisting the Malian government in implementing a programme to improve rights and access to sexual and reproductive health care. The Organization's support includes strengthening the legal framework, improving the skills of health care providers, supplying medical equipment, setting up clinics tailored to the needs of young people, and producing reliable data to guide public policy.\"This programme is part of our strategic plan and aims to guarantee healthcare rights, particularly for young people and adolescents,” says Dr N'Tji Keita, Head of the Maternal and Child Health Department at the National Office for Reproductive Health. “We have been able to train magistrates on the new WHO guidelines, set up a national health observatory and strengthen the maternal mortality surveillance system.\"WHO also support coordinating and supervision of activities. Thanks to the support, Mali has published its first national bulletin on sexual and reproductive health indicators, as well as the 2022 National Health Data. These facilitate better operational analysis and guide strategic decisions.\"We have supported the establishment of a Mother-Child-Adolescent clinic in Sikasso, which will offer integrated family planning and gender-based violence services. A mobile team is also ready to operate in Macina humanitarian zone. These initiatives aim to bring services closer to the most vulnerable populations,\" says Dr Sylla Ousmane, head of the Sexual and Reproductive Health Programme at the WHO office in Mali.Trained and committed midwives are at the heart of the system improving adolescent girls’. “I have received several training courses on refocused prenatal consultations, family planning, STI/HIV/AIDS care and medical prescriptions. This has improved my performance and enabled me to welcome young women without judgement,” says Aïssata, a midwife.Assetou, a mentor midwife in Yanfolila, about 160 kilometres south of Bamako, notes that “these training courses have brought about a big change in the way I work, particularly in terms of listening, availability and respect for consent.” Between 2019 and 2025, the number of young people and adolescents who have benefited from sexual and reproductive health services at her centre has more than doubled, from 2 330 to 5 121.These improvements cannot be measured solely in numbers, but also in attitudes and behaviours. Thanks to awareness campaigns in schools, radio programmes on sexuality and training for healthcare providers on listening and respecting consent, young girls now dare to walk through the doors of health centres. Dialogue is opening up, taboos are receding, and trust is gradually being established.For Kadidia, this transformation is tangible. She remembers her first visit to the health centre: “The lady who saw me made me feel at ease, listened to me without judging me and gave me good advice. I can say that this service contributes to our well-being. I want to say to young girls: ‘don't be afraid, go and seek advice, they are there to help us’,” says Kadidia.",

        "text_s": "Andra Chigova, a 10-year-old girl from Windhoek, Namibia, is encouraging other girls to get vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes most cervical cancers. “I just got my HPV vaccination today. Do not be scared ‒ the HPV vaccine will protect us in the future against cervical cancer,” she says.Chigova is one of the thousands of girls who have received the HPV vaccine through the national campaign launched by the Ministry of Health and Social Services in August 2025, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners. The campaign targets around 232 000 girls aged 9 to 14 years across all 14 regions of Namibia. During the initial two weeks of the campaign, which ran from 4‒15 August 2025, around 65 000 girls were vaccinated.Chigova’s parents educated her about the importance of the vaccine and how it will protect her from cervical cancer as she grows older. “Nothing makes me happier than knowing my daughter is now protected from cervical cancer,” says her mother, Temptation Chigova. “I have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact this disease has on women, their families and entire communities. I am truly grateful to the Government of Namibia for ensuring that our daughters will not have to endure the same pain.”Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with an estimated 660 000 new cases in 2022. Almost 94% of the 350 000 cervical cancer deaths that year occurred in low- and middle-income countries.The disease remains a pressing public health challenge in Namibia, with an estimated 350 new cases and more than 200 deaths each year. To address this, Namibia has aligned with WHO’s Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer, which sets ambitious targets: vaccinating 90% of girls against HPV by age 15; screening 70% of women by ages 35 and 45; and ensuring 90% of women with cervical cancer disease receive timely treatment. The national HPV vaccination campaign is key to Namibia’s strategy to reduce the burden of cervical cancer.According to Ramona Mbadeka, a nurse at Groot Aub Clinic on the outskirts of Windhoek, health workers are reaching out to parents to provide information and dispel any misinformation about the vaccine. “Some parents who initially refused to allow their daughters to be vaccinated later consented after attending an information session on the vaccine,” he says. “The vaccine is voluntary and I encourage parents to educate themselves with accurate information.”Dr Esperance Luvindao, Minister of Health and Social Services in Namibia, reiterates that the vaccine is safe and effective. “We are seeing far too many women affected by this preventable illness. The numbers speak for themselves,” she says. “We welcome questions and are here to provide accurate information so families can make informed decisions based on facts, not fear or misinformation.”Before and during the two-week campaign WHO worked with health authorities to provide supportive supervision to monitor progress at service delivery points, including health facilities and schools. The Organization supported a technical mission to strengthen planning, logistics, training and community engagement, addressing misinformation and operational gaps. In addition, WHO supported the development of the National HPV Vaccine Introduction Plan and the vaccination communication strategy. As part of its risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) efforts, WHO contributed to the development of information materials, media monitoring and the delivery of training modules for health workers, regional RCCE officers and community health workers.“The ongoing HPV vaccination campaign aims to prevent infection, protect health and save the lives of our young girls from cervical cancer in the years to come,” says Dr Richard Banda, WHO Representative in Namibia. “I congratulate the Government of Namibia in this milestone in its public health journey.”For Chigova, the campaign is not just about numbers but rather the promise of a healthy future for herself and her peers. “Now I feel happy because I know I am protected,” she says.",

        "text_s": "In an important step to reduce maternal mortality, Guinea-Bissau has launched its first-ever national guidelines for maternal health, focused on improving care before, during and after childbirth.The Ministry of Health, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, led the development of this new national framework to guide maternal health services. The goal is to curb maternal deaths, estimated to be about 500 per 100 000 live births. Under the Sustainable Development Goals maternal mortality reduction targets, countries should aim to lower maternal deaths to under 70 per 100 000 live births.Guinea-Bissau has not had standard clinical protocols for maternal care. This made it difficult to provide consistent, high-quality services and contributed to avoidable deaths among mothers and newborns.“One of the major gaps in our health system has been the absence of standardized norms for maternal and child care. Each region, facility and health worker has been providing care in their own way,” says Dr Elizio Junior Baldé Ferreira, Gynecologist-Obstetrician and Director of Sexual and Reproductive Health Service at the Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP), Guinea-Bissau.“For the first time, we now have national standards for prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care that will guide all maternity care providers and will certainly facilitate the monitoring of quality of care throughout the national territory,” adds Dr Baldé.In Guinea-Bissau, around 81% of pregnant women attend at least four antenatal care visits, but only around 50% of all births are assisted by skilled health workers. Skilled support is critical to detect risks early, manage complications and ensure safe delivery. Without it, common issues like heavy bleeding, infections or high blood pressure can quickly become life-threatening. Yet, many women still face barriers to accessing the care they need throughout pregnancy and childbirth.WHO recommends eight antenatal visits to better protect the health of mothers and newborns. The country is working to meet this target and increase the number of births that take place in health facilities under professional care.Health experts, nurses, government agencies and partners worked together to develop and validate the new guidelines. The document defines essential medicines, clinical procedures and key service indicators for maternal care. It also lays the foundation for training health workers, strengthening supervision and improving service delivery across the country.The Ministry of Health approved the new approach following the launch of its National Health Strategy Plan 2023–2028. The plan also calls for more policies for expanding and integrating reproductive, maternal, newborn child and adolescent health services across the country.WHO supported the Ministry of Health throughout the process, providing technical expertise to align the guidelines with global best practices. The Organization coordinated partner engagement, facilitated validation and led advocacy efforts to promote national ownership and long-term impact.“The assessment tool developed by WHO provided a clear picture of how existing practices on the ground align with WHO recommendations,\" said Dr Daisy Trovoada, specialist in reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent from WHO Regional Office for Africa. \"It also helped identify priority actions for the national guidelines for improving antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care.”Health authorities have begun using the new standards in the regions of Bolama in the southwest, Farim in the north-central region, and Gabu in the east. In the next months, they will train and supervise health workers to improve care, help more women attend the recommended eight antenatal visits and support safer births in health facilities.This new framework is also helping partners better plan and provide the medical equipment needed for quality care and support training, supervision and better health services.“By setting clear health standards and strengthening services, Guinea-Bissau is working to lower the number of maternal deaths and improving life expectancy across the population,” says Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, Acting WHO Representative in Guinea-Bissau. “We are proud to stand with the Ministry of Health in building a er, more equitable health system for all.”These efforts directly support the Sustainable Development Goals, by helping reduce maternal and newborn deaths and moving closer to universal access to quality health care. As Guinea-Bissau continues rolling out the new standards, sustained investment, coordination and training will be essential to improve outcomes and ensure that more women and babies receive the care they need ‒ before, during and after birth.",

        "text_s": "When Angèle, a young mother living on Mbamou Island, began experiencing abdominal pain a few weeks after giving birth, she thought it was just a minor discomfort. But the symptoms worsened, revealing a cholera infection. \"I didn’t understand what was happening to me. The pain started mildly, then became unbearable. I had stomach aches, fever, and felt very weak. I thought it was normal after childbirth. I didn’t think it was an illness.\"Since July 26, 2025, the Republic of Congo has been facing a cholera outbreak that has affected over 430 people and caused 34 deaths. The most affected age group is between 15 to 24 years old, and the hardest-hit areas are Mbamou Island, Talangaï in Brazzaville Department, and Mossaka-Loukolela in Congo-Oubangui Department.Upon the official declaration of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO), working with the government and partners quickly activated its Incident Management System (IMST) and supported the deployment of three multidisciplinary teams to priority areas. These teams helped structure the response, confirm cases, and strengthen national capacities in close collaboration with field actors.WHO’s support included the delivery of 7 tons of cholera medicines and kits, the establishment of treatment centers in Mbamou, Mossaka, and Talangaï, training of 172 health workers in case management and infection prevention, and the education of 250 community relays on preventive measures. WHO also provided a speedboat to facilitate transport between Mbamou Island and Brazzaville, enhanced surveillance at entry points, and supported the disinfection of 61 wells and several health facilities.On the ground, health professionals witnessed improvements, thanks to this support. Dr Nelson Bokale, the chief medical officer of Mbamou Island’s health district, recalls the difficult beginning. \"For nearly five years, I’ve faced many challenges, but the cholera outbreak response was particularly significant. Before the support arrived, we did what we could with available resources. The arrival of the Surge support team was a turning point. It strengthened our efforts and allowed us to organize a more structured response,\" he emphasized.WHO also supported epidemiological surveillance, active case finding, and the setup of water circuits for treatment units. Experts in infectious diseases, logistics, hygiene, water and sanitation, and risk communication were also mobilized. Thanks to these joint efforts, the outbreak’s dynamics have shifted, and indicators are improving. On Mbamou Island in particular, the fatality rate was halved, dropping from 11.7% to 4.8% within two weeks. As of August 15, 2025, of the 12 active cases on the island, 5 are hospitalized while the other 7 are receiving outpatient care.During a field visit, Dr Vincent Dossou Sodjinou, WHO Representative in Congo, described the progress with optimism. \"The trend of the outbreak is declining.

But the symtoms worsened, revealing a cholera infection. \"I didn’t understand what was haening to me. The ain started mildly, then became unbearable. I had stomach aches, fever, and felt very weak. I thought it was normal after childbirth. I didn’t think it was an illness.\"Since July 26, 2025, the Reublic of Congo has been facing a cholera outbreak that has affected over 430 eole and caused 34 deaths. The most affected age grou is between 15 to 24 years old, and the hardest-hit areas are Mbamou Island, Talangaï in Brazzaville Deartment, and Mossaka-Loukolela in Congo-Oubangui Deartment.Uon the official declaration of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO), working with the government and artners quickly activated its Incident Management System (IMST) and suorted the deloyment of three multidiscilinary teams to riority areas. These teams heled structure the resonse, confirm cases, and strengthen national caacities in close collaboration with field actors.WHO’s suort included the delivery of 7 tons of cholera medicines and kits, the establishment of treatment centers in Mbamou, Mossaka, and Talangaï, training of 172 health workers in case management and infection revention, and the education of 250 community relays on reventive measures. WHO also rovided a seedboat to facilitate transort between Mbamou Island and Brazzaville, enhanced surveillance at entry oints, and suorted the disinfection of 61 wells and several health facilities.On the ground, health rofessionals witnessed imrovements, thanks to this suort. Dr Nelson Bokale, the chief medical officer of Mbamou Island’s health district, recalls the difficult beginning. \"For nearly five years, I’ve faced many challenges, but the cholera outbreak resonse was articularly significant. Before the suort arrived, we did what we could with available resources. The arrival of the Surge suort team was a turning oint. It strengthened our efforts and allowed us to organize a more structured resonse,\" he emhasized.WHO also suorted eidemiological surveillance, active case finding, and the setu of water circuits for treatment units. Exerts in infectious diseases, logistics, hygiene, water and sanitation, and risk communication were also mobilized. Thanks to these joint efforts, the outbreak’s dynamics have shifted, and indicators are imroving. On Mbamou Island in articular, the fatality rate was halved, droing from 11.7% to 4.8% within two weeks. As of August 15, 2025, of the 12 active cases on the island, 5 are hositalized while the other 7 are receiving outatient care.During a field visit, Dr Vincent Dossou Sodjinou, WHO Reresentative in Congo, described the rogress with otimism. \"The trend of the outbreak is declining.

This year's theme, “Strengthening global solidarity and empowering local communities,” focused on recognizing the critical role of local actors in humanitarian response.Abidine Ould Sidewa, a nurse at Mbera refugee camp in Mauritania, describes his contribution in protecting the vulnerable and providing for people in need of humanitarian assistance.What led you to be involved in humanitarian work? What is your role at the Mberra camp triage centre?I started as a trader in Timbuktu (in Mali), but it was when I discovered community health work that I truly understood what it meant, such as being helpful, listening and supporting others. This is what inspired me to train as a nurse in 1998. Since then, I have been committed to serving all people in need, regardless of their origin.Since April 2024, I have been working at the triage centre for new arrivals from Mali. We provide consultations, malnutrition screening, vaccinations for zero-dose children and awareness-raising. This system enables us to identify individuals who are ill before they integrate into the community, which has significantly reduced community deaths.What are the common diseases you handle and how do you raise awareness among communities?In the field, I deal with diseases that mainly affect children and women: acute respiratory infections, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, measles and, mostly, malnutrition. These conditions are often worsened by a lack of access to healthcare, safe drinking water and a balanced diet.To raise awareness among the population, I take a tailored approach for each context. I talk to mothers, community leaders and young people. I inform them about the importance of vaccination, simple hygiene practices, the risks associated with births unattended by a skilled health worker, and the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding. I also rely on community leaders and dialogue sessions to convey messages clearly and respectfully. I always emphasize the importance of following vaccination schedule, as it saves lives.Can you tell us about any incident that has stayed with?In 2022. I met a pregnant refugee woman, alone with two young children, both suffering from severe malnutrition. She was distrustful, exhausted and refused treatment for religious reasons. I took the time to listen to her, to understand her fears and beliefs. It wasn't easy, but little by little, she began to trust me.I arranged for her to be transferred to a health centre, organized nutritional care for her children, and accompanied her throughout her journey, right up to delivery. She gave birth to a healthy baby. That day, she thanked me emotionally. It brough tears to my eyes.What progress give you confidence in the future of local humanitarian action?I see real transformation: communities are becoming aware of their role, asking questions and getting involved. Collaboration with the police, the structured reception of new arrivals, and growing interest in health show that humanitarian work is no longer limited to emergencies. It is becoming a driver of recovery and empowerment.For me, reaching the most vulnerable is not just about providing care or resources. Above all, it means recognizing their humanity and their fundamental right to live in safety, in good health and with hope. Humanitarian aid begins when we refuse to look away.

Within days, breathing difficulties and the tell-tale thick grey coating in some throats confirmed an outbreak of diphtheria.In a densely populated refugee setting with limited health infrastructure, even a handful of cases could quickly spiral into crisis. Mauritania’s Ministry of Health, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and humanitarian partners, moved fast. Within 72 hours of laboratory confirmation, a full outbreak response was under way.Between July and September 2024, at least ten cases of diphtheria, including two deaths, were recorded in the Mberra camp. Of these cases, eight were in children, six of whom were under five years of age, all of whom were unvaccinated. In response, more than a thousand people were vaccinated, including nearly 70 health professionals.In addition, over two tonnes of emergency supplies were delivered to the camp, including antitoxins, antibiotics, personal protective equipment and disinfectants. WHO deployed technical experts to support case investigation, contact tracing and coordination with national and local teams. Community health workers were rapidly trained to identify symptoms, isolate cases and provide prevention education to families.“Before the training, many of us had never seen a case of diphtheria,” says Fatou, a community health volunteer. “Now we know what to look for, and how to respond.”A targeted risk communication and community engagement campaign used megaphones, posters and local radio in multiple languages to build trust, educate communities and ensure early reporting of symptoms.Thanks to this rapid, coordinated approach, the outbreak was contained within weeks. No deaths were reported, and all cases remained confined to the initial cluster.\"This was a textbook example of what rapid mobilization and partnership can achieve,\" says Dr Charlotte Faty Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Mauritania. \"In a fragile setting like Mberra, early action saved lives.\"The experience underlined the importance of preparedness, coordination and community engagement in humanitarian contexts.

        "text_s": "In an effort to address severely limited access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services in South Sudan, the Ministry of Health, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, has been implementing several initiatives to expand access in seven of its 10 states.Years of overlapping humanitarian crises, including infectious disease outbreaks and complex humanitarian crises driven by conflict and climate-related disasters have disrupted health systems, limiting access to essential health services, including SRHR.As a result, South Sudan continues to face some of the gravest SRHR challenges globally. Access to family planning is low, with a modern contraceptive prevalence rate of around 6% and an adolescent birth rate of 97 per 1000 girls between aged 15‒19 years.The country’s maternal mortality ratio is estimated at 692 deaths per 100 000 live births, with around 10% linked to complications from unsafe abortion. The country’s legislation permits abortion only when the mother’s life is at risk. Despite these legal constraints, women may seek unsafe abortion services, often arriving at health facilities with severe post-abortion complications.With only around 40% of births attended by skilled birth attendants, other key contributors to maternal mortality include postpartum haemorrhage, obstructed labour and sepsis ‒ all of which are preventable with timely access to quality health care.Health authorities, with support from WHO and partners, have focused on expanding access to care that responds to people’s needs, choices and rights, through resilient primary health systems. This has been done by strengthening coordination, training health workers and improving monitoring. Targeted efforts have focused on equipping health workers with the knowledge and skills they need to deliver better care.In the northwestern states of Warrap and Northern Bahr el Ghazal, in 2024, 50 health workers were trained in maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response, an important step toward strengthening how maternal and newborn deaths are identified, reported and addressed.An additional 50 health workers were trained in family planning in Torit and Wau, expanding access to voluntary contraceptive services in primary health centres. In Torit, Malakal, Renk and Wau states, 94 health workers received specialized training in the clinical management of rape, ensuring that survivors of gender-based violence from refugee, returnee and host communities can access timely, compassionate care.“The training has also enabled me to diagnose patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. It has really expanded my knowledge and allowing me to assist many mothers,” says Faida Jackline, a 29-year-old midwife from Kator Primary Health Care Centre in Juba.Improving access to services also means working with communities to create demand and address stigma and misinformation. Because SRHR services have been absent in the past, many people do not know that they are available. Through dialogues, more than 540 local and religious leaders across five states have been oriented on the concepts underpinning SRHR, helping to increase awareness and promote greater use of available services among communities.WHO has supported the development of national post-abortion care guidelines, recognizing the critical role of safe and timely post-abortion care in preventing maternal deaths. The new guidelines focus on the management of complications from both spontaneous and unsafe abortions.Around 15 health workers from selected primary health care facilities were trained in the new guidelines and at least 30% of the 35 targeted health centres have been equipped with the necessary tools and supplies to deliver post-abortion care, including manual vacuum aspirators, beds, speculums and consumables.“In collaboration with WHO, we have been able to successfully implement cervical cancer screening and post-abortion care management in six health facilities within Juba County. We have trained 14 midwives, who are currently doing excellent job screening patients in these six facilities. We sincerely thank WHO and partners for this collaboration,” says Vivian Hawa, Reproductive Health Coordinator at Central Equatoria State’s Ministry of Health.During 2024, the first year of the project 934 women accessed care for post-abortion complications. This includes 68 health clients from primary health facilities, which initially never had the capacity to provide post-abortion care services.“Previously we never use to provide post-abortion care at this facility, especially manual vacuum aspiration. However, after receiving the training in 2024, we are now able to attend to women who have had unsafe abortions and perform other post-abortion care procedures,” says Kenyi Emmanuel Wani, a 27-year-old midwife from Munuki Primary Healthcare Centre in Juba, the country’s capital.As the programme is ending its second year, continued collaboration and investment will be essential to build on these early gains and contribute to longer-term improvements in reproductive health outcomes across the country.“Access to quality SRHR services is a matter of dignity, rights, and resilience. South Sudan is making important strides to allow women and girls to gain access to the care they need,” says Dr Humphrey Karamagi, WHO Representative to South Sudan. “WHO is proud to support the Ministry of Health in strengthening the health system and ensuring that no one is left behind.”",

Between 1 January and 31 May 2025, the country reported more than 12 000 suspected cases and 22 deaths, accounting for over 50% of all mpox cases in Africa this year.In response, World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are supporting the country’s efforts to strengthen clinical care, improve detection and build the skills and engagement of frontline responders.GOARN, a network coordinated by WHO that supports countries respond to health emergencies by deploying personnel and resources, mobilized seven specialists to support Democratic Republic of the Congo’s mpox response. Working both on the ground and remotely from Nairobi, the team provided expertise in treatment, data analysis, epidemiology, and disease surveillance.Among them was Dr Andre Basilua Muzembo, a case management specialist from the University of Hyogo in Japan. Over nearly two months, he worked with health professionals at national level and WHO teams covering logistics, infection prevention, vaccination, and mpox response to ensure effective coordination.At Clinique Kinoise, Kinshasa’s main referral centre for severe mpox cases, he provided support to help address critical challenges. The facility, with 42 beds and an average of 20 patients, operated with just around five out of 95 staff trained on mpox management. Chronic shortages of gloves, medicines, and essential equipment, combined with limited access to laboratory testing and difficult working conditions, contributed to a mortality rate of around 10%.During more than 30 visits to five mpox treatment centres across Kinshasa, mainly in Clinique Kinoise, he mentored staff in compassionate care, worked with colleagues to improve hygiene practices and helped coordinate delivery of medicines and medical supplies. He also worked closely with Kokolo, Vijana, Masina Cinquantenaire and Kinkole treatment centres to streamline referrals and maintain continuity of care.The response team placed special attention to high-risk groups, including children, pregnant women, and people living with HIV. Some pregnant patients arrived with foetal deaths, partly due to difficulties in accessing essential diagnostic tools such as ultrasound. In collaboration with the National AIDS Control Programme (PNMLS) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), at least five HIV-Mpox co-infected patients were referred for specialized treatment.When two mpox cases were detected in a Kinshasa orphanage, an emergency vaccination reached 30 people at risk. Alerts on cases of infected prisoners at Kokolo Hospital, followed by more than 30 cases reported at Ndolo prison, underscored the need for sustained outreach in vulnerable settings.As part of efforts to strengthen the health system beyond the immediate response, 59 front-line workers, including 27 doctors and 32 nurses from the Clinique Kinoise received training in clinical management of mpox.Heavy flooding then complicated the outbreak response, requiring a more coordinated and multisectoral efforts. Response teams faced overlapping emergencies—managing mpox and cholera while supporting displaced communities. At four evacuation sites, including Stade Tata Raphaël and Bandalungwa, WHO and partners delivered essential supplies such as medicines, cholera kits, and hygiene items.\"Despite extremely difficult working conditions, I witnessed how important it was to work to save lives with determination, compassion and team spirit. Resilience is not just about coping with adversity, it's about living through it with those affected, listening to those on the edge of despair and doing what we can with even the most modest of means,\" says Dr Muzembo.These deployments are possible thanks to the support of UK public health rapid support team, Public health agency of Canada, Research institute of nursing care for people and community, University of Hyogo, and European centre for disease prevention and control.“This mission underscores the critical importance of partnership and collaboration in health emergencies,” said Dr Jerry-Jonas Mbasha, GOARN focal point at WHO Regional Office for Africa and WHO operational partnerships officer. “GOARN is a vital pillar in the Global Health Emergency Corps, ensuring a coordinated health emergency workforce that is both rooted in countries and connected regionally and globally.”“GOARN brings in targeted expertise to address critical gaps on the ground. With hands-on support and capacity strengthening, we are empowering countries to manage emergencies themselves. While the challenges in DRC remain, our continued mission is to work together, contain the outbreak, and build long-term resilience in the health system,” says Dr Mbasha.As the DRC continues to respond to mpox, joint efforts by national and international partners highlight the importance of collaboration. \"This mission has not only helped us respond to the outbreak but also strengthened the local health system in ways that will last well beyond the end of the current crisis,\" says Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
