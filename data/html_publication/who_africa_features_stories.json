        "text_s": "The cholera outbreak is significantly declining in Congo. No confirmed cases were reported between 15 and 16 October 2025. This progress is the result of strengthened response efforts led by the Ministry of Health and Population, with support from partners including World Health Organization (WHO).“Before the cholera treatment centre was established, we recorded deaths due to the disease. But since the CTC opened in early August, no cholera-related deaths have been reported in our health area,” said Dr Juicael Bokoba, care coordinator at the Integrated Health Centre (CSI) in Loukoléla.Mossaka-Loukoléla is one of four districts affected by the cholera outbreak in Congo, accounting for 52% of the 808 cases reported nationally as of 16 October 2025, including 66 confirmed and 742 suspected cases. To strengthen patient care, WHO, through the Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE), set up four cholera treatment centres (CTCs) in the affected districts, including one at the CSI in Loukoléla.Alongside equipping the centres and deploying rapid response and mobile lab teams, WHO trained 88 frontline workers in case management, infection prevention and control. The organization also delivered over 14 tons of medical supplies, including medicines, water treatment products and lab kits.With these kits available, Ghislain Dzeret Indolo, one of the lab technicians deployed in the field, ensures thorough detection using the mobile lab. “Around the Congo River, diarrhoea cases are common, but not all are cholera. That’s why it’s important to test for antigens and other causes,” he explained. “We trace the causes and analyse for co-infections.”Thanks to improved equipment and strengthened health worker capacity, patient care has significantly improved and hospital deaths have decreased. Of the 67 deaths recorded since the outbreak began, 56 (83.6%) occurred in the community and 11 (16.4%) in health facilities.Since most deaths occurred in the community, health authorities have intensified risk communication and community engagement efforts. A total of 173 community health workers have been trained. Their role is to raise awareness about seeking care at the first signs of symptoms and promote preventive measures.“We received training from the WHO team on how to raise awareness, treat drinking water to prevent cholera and adopt hygiene measures,” said David Akini Maya, a community health worker in Mossaka. “We’re often consulted by the community. Our awareness sessions have a  impact because we share useful information and distribute chlorine tablets to purify water. We also teach them how to treat water to prevent the disease.”To improve access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation, around 100 health professionals were trained, with WHO’s support, in water treatment and quality monitoring in health centres and communities. Treating drinking water with chlorine is a key measure to break the transmission chain.“When we add chlorine to water, it kills microbes and prevents diarrheal diseases. Drinking chlorinated water protects us,” explained Mamadou Zongo, health logistician at WHO’s Regional Office for Africa. “If chlorine isn’t available, we recommend boiling the water and letting it cool for at least 10 minutes before drinking.”Françoise Komboli, a 36-year-old resident of Mossaka, is now putting these and other measures into practice. She nearly lost her two-year-old daughter to cholera. “Around 4 p.m., my daughter started vomiting and had diarrhoea. By 7 p.m., her condition got worse. I had to take her to the hospital,” she recalled. “At the hospital, they took excellent care of her. Without that quick intervention, my daughter might not be alive today. The nurses did a great job. I thank the hospital team for saving her.”Every recovered patient is a step closer to ending the cholera outbreak in Congo. “Our hope is to end this outbreak quickly and continue our shared journey to strengthen the country’s health system,” concluded Dr Vincent Dossou Sodjinou, WHO Representative in Congo.",

        "text_s": "Fifty-four-year-old Jacob Mukaba, who lost his wife recently to Ebola, is observing a 40-day mourning period during which he must not leave his home. This practice among the Kete community in Bulape, a locality in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kasai Province and the epicentre of the ongoing Ebola outbreak—is working to the advantage of disease surveillance teams.The practice, akin to a quarantine, facilitates monitoring of contacts of confirmed Ebola cases, as it limits movement of contacts and allows response teams to easily follow up on them to ensure swift and effective care is provided should they develop symptoms.“I’m observing the 40-day mourning period and following instructions as a contact person. It’s not easy, but I’m confident it will be okay,” says a visibly emotional Mukaba.Every day, health teams visit him to monitor his health. The visits are vital for immediate support as well as facilitating vaccination of all high-risk contacts. “It’s what allows us to detect and break the chain of transmission, especially through contact tracing,” says Dr John Otshudiema, epidemiologist and head of the World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance team in Bulape, pointing out that disease surveillance is the cornerstone of the Ebola response.In Bulape, more than 250 frontline workers carry out disease surveillance, most of them are trained community health workers skilled in disease detection, contact tracing and public health awareness. On average, 50 Ebola alerts are investigated each day and nearly 10 suspected cases are isolated for testing.Since the start of the outbreak, almost a thousand alerts have been reported, leading to the identification of 64 cases (53 confirmed and 11 probable). More than 2300 contacts have been monitored for 21 days and vaccinated.However, challenges remain. Some localities are isolated and reachable only after hours of traversing forests or swamps. “Sometimes it takes two hours to cover just 24 kilometers by motorbike,” says Dr Otshudiema. “But that doesn’t stop us from going all the way, even to the most remote camps.”Dr Richard Kitenge, Ebola incident manager for the Ministry of Health, commends this determination. “Many indicators show progress. All contacts are seen daily. We have very few unmonitored cases thanks to close supervision and effective coordination between the Ministry and WHO,” he notes. “Nineteen days without a case is not yet a victory. We must remain vigilant every day, as if it were the first.”Support to the national authorities from WHO and partners has been crucial. More than 20 national epidemiologists, six vehicles (including two ambulances), 150 tonnes of medical supplies, 12 off-road motorcycles, and 200 tablets for rapid data transmission. WHO has also organized several training sessions for epidemiologists, community health workers and local surveillance teams to enhance their skills in early detection, rapid alert investigation, ambulance evacuation, isolation at Ebola treatment centers and contact tracing.“We’re er together. The close collaboration between the Ministry and WHO has strengthened prevention, detection, and responsiveness,” says Dr Jean Djemba, expert at the Directorate of Epidemiological Surveillance at the Ministry of Health.An important strategy in the ongoing response is the twice-daily contact follow-up, a strategy learned from previous outbreaks.“In some epidemics, follow-up was done only once a day. Here, we’ve implemented two daily visits, which allows earlier detection of symptoms and faster action,” says Dr Mory Keita, Ebola incident manager for WHO Regional Office for Africa. “This precision work is vital. In surveillance, 99% is not enough. We must reach 100%, because the missing 1% can reignite the outbreak.”The response in Bulape also relies on  community mobilization. Village leaders accompany follow-up teams and raise awareness about vaccination and isolation.Community forums are regularly held to identify high-risk contacts and encourage cooperation. This shared vigilance has become an important measure to in the efforts to halt the spread of the virus.“Epidemiological surveillance is not just a technique — it’s a bridge between communities and public health,” says Dr Keita. “It’s through surveillance that we move forward, not just against Ebola, but to build trust, dignity, and resilience in our health systems.”",

The approach has made it possible to reach Uganda’s key populations‒meeting people where they live, work and socialize.World Health Organization (WHO) in partnership with Most at Risk Populations Initiative (MARPI) Clinic Mulago are carrying out the campaign to vaccinate sex workers, lorry drivers, fisherfolk and other populations often underserved by mainstream health systems.With WHO support, MARPI has trained health workers and peer educators to recognize symptoms, share accurate information and guide people to seek care. Civil society groups mobilized their networks, while individuals like Ruth Kyomugisha (one of the peers) leveraged WhatsApp and personal connections to raise awareness. “During the training, we learned how to spot symptoms early and respond immediately. This knowledge has saved lives,\" she says. Ruth’s outreach through tools like WhatsApp posters led to the identification of suspected cases and connection to timely care.”“I thought I was alone in this,” says a bar attendant in Rubaga Division, Kampala city. “But MARPI found me, took care of me, and ensured I got treatment. The doctors and peers treated me like a human being, not just a case.”Recognizing that many of these population groups work late hours, vaccination sessions were designed to run into the night. Teams set up in brothels, bars and truck stops, following peer movement plans to reach the greatest number of people. On some nights, popular DJs announced mpox symptoms and vaccination opportunities between music sets, turning entertainment venues into spaces of health education.Brothel and bar owners also played a crucial part by opening their doors and encouraging participation. “When the bar owner told us the vaccine team was coming, we felt safe. It wasn’t just strangers, but people we knew,” explained a sex worker.A broad coalition of partners reinforced the effort. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and the Infectious Diseases Institute provided funding, logistics and training support, while government structures ensured smooth coordination.Anthropologists deployed through African Volunteers Health Corps-Strengthening and Utilizing Response Groups for Emergencies (AVoHC-SURGE) worked closely with communities to address fear and reduce hesitancy. Regular meetings have also helped resolve challenges in real time and sustain momentum. Mapping transport corridors and truck stops also enabled outreach teams to reach highly mobile groups, with estimates of more than 300 000 sex workers and nearly 500 000 drivers identified as priority targets.",

        "text_s": "For years, the 20 000 residents of Bulape have lived with a harsh reality: to fetch water, they had to walk several kilometres through the forest, often at dawn or dusk, to reach stagnant and unsafe pools.“The water was often dirty, but we had no choice,” recalls Henriette Byongo, a mother of seven. The long trek stole hours from women’s days, delayed children on their way to school, and fuelled outbreaks of waterborne diseases.That all changed with the installation of a water supply system, initiated by World Health Organization (WHO), in partnership with national and local authorities. Set up to support the Ebola response following the outbreak of the disease declared on 4 September 2025, the system has gone on to transform life beyond the emergency.“The danger was everywhere,” says Dr Serge Bulangyene Loso, medical director at Bulape General Referral Hospital. “Without water, we couldn’t disinfect, wash hands or provide safe care. We did what we could, but we knew it wasn’t enough.”A sustainable solution was urgently needed—one that could meet the immediate demands of the Ebola response, while leaving a long-term legacy of health and dignity.The answer came through an ingenious system: a protected spring 2.5 kilometres from the village was tapped and connected to Bulape by a network of pipes. Two large storage tanks now hold 20 000 litres of water, continuously supplying the hospital, the Ebola Treatment Centre and several community access points.A dual-flow mechanism delivers chlorinated water for clinical use and untreated water for household needs, ensuring both infection control and everyday supply.“The water we use now is clean, drinkable and safe,” says Dr Loso. “It’s not just a comfort – it’s survival.”The installation meets WHO’s standards for water, hygiene and sanitation, providing up to 150 litres per person per day—a remarkable achievement in such a remote area, and a testament to equitable access in action.Implementation was not easy. Rugged terrain and the distance from the source had thwarted several earlier attempts.“Some people said it was impossible,” recalls Mamadou Zongo, a WHO health logistician. “But with the right decisions at the right time—and the resources mobilized by WHO and its partners—we designed a system that is simple, robust and adapted to the terrain.”That combination of technical ingenuity and  community mobilization made the difference. Villagers joined from day one, digging trenches, carrying materials and connecting pipes. Today, they maintain the network themselves, a sign of true local ownership.“This is more than infrastructure,” says Zongo. “It is a collective achievement born of solidarity and the will to build a better future.”For Dr Richard Kitenge, Incident Manager for the Ministry of Health’s Ebola response, the lesson is clear: “Water is the first line of defence. Without it, there is no hygiene, no safe care, no prevention. Bulape shows how a coordinated response can go beyond the emergency and leave a lasting legacy.”Dr Mory Keita, WHO Africa’s Incident Manager for the Ebola response, echoes this sentiment: “This water source doesn’t just help fight Ebola. It restores confidence, dignity and community resilience. It strengthens both health and the social fabric of the village.”At the community water point—six taps in a neat row—life in Bulape now flows to a new rhythm. Children play around the basins; women exchange news and containers fill without haste. What was once a daily struggle has become a space of connection and renewal.As Byongo fills her container, she smiles: “This water is our collective victory,” she says, surrounded by laughter and conversation. “It has changed our lives. It gives us hope—for our children, for our health and for everything we have built together.”",
        "text_p": "For years, the 20 000 residents of Bulae have lived with a harsh reality: to fetch water, they had to walk several kilometres through the forest, often at dawn or dusk, to reach stagnant and unsafe ools.“The water was often dirty, but we had no choice,” recalls Henriette Byongo, a mother of seven. The long trek stole hours from women’s days, delayed children on their way to school, and fuelled outbreaks of waterborne diseases.That all changed with the installation of a water suly system, initiated by World Health Organization (WHO), in artnershi with national and local authorities. Set u to suort the Ebola resonse following the outbreak of the disease declared on 4 Setember 2025, the system has gone on to transform life beyond the emergency.“The danger was everywhere,” says Dr Serge Bulangyene Loso, medical director at Bulae General Referral Hosital. “Without water, we couldn’t disinfect, wash hands or rovide safe care. We did what we could, but we knew it wasn’t enough.”A sustainable solution was urgently needed—one that could meet the immediate demands of the Ebola resonse, while leaving a long-term legacy of health and dignity.The answer came through an ingenious system: a rotected sring 2.5 kilometres from the village was taed and connected to Bulae by a network of ies. Two large storage tanks now hold 20 000 litres of water, continuously sulying the hosital, the Ebola Treatment Centre and several community access oints.A dual-flow mechanism delivers chlorinated water for clinical use and untreated water for household needs, ensuring both infection control and everyday suly.“The water we use now is clean, drinkable and safe,” says Dr Loso. “It’s not just a comfort – it’s survival.”The installation meets WHO’s standards for water, hygiene and sanitation, roviding u to 150 litres er erson er day—a remarkable achievement in such a remote area, and a testament to equitable access in action.Imlementation was not easy. Rugged terrain and the distance from the source had thwarted several earlier attemts.“Some eole said it was imossible,” recalls Mamadou Zongo, a WHO health logistician. “But with the right decisions at the right time—and the resources mobilized by WHO and its artners—we designed a system that is simle, robust and adated to the terrain.”That combination of technical ingenuity and strong community mobilization made the difference. Villagers joined from day one, digging trenches, carrying materials and connecting ies. Today, they maintain the network themselves, a sign of true local ownershi.“This is more than infrastructure,” says Zongo. “It is a collective achievement born of solidarity and the will to build a better future.”For Dr Richard Kitenge, Incident Manager for the Ministry of Health’s Ebola resonse, the lesson is clear: “Water is the first line of defence. Without it, there is no hygiene, no safe care, no revention. Bulae shows how a coordinated resonse can go beyond the emergency and leave a lasting legacy.”Dr Mory Keita, WHO Africa’s Incident Manager for the Ebola resonse, echoes this sentiment: “This water source doesn’t just hel fight Ebola. It restores confidence, dignity and community resilience. It strengthens both health and the social fabric of the village.”At the community water oint—six tas in a neat row—life in Bulae now flows to a new rhythm. Children lay around the basins; women exchange news and containers fill without haste. What was once a daily struggle has become a sace of connection and renewal.As Byongo fills her container, she smiles: “This water is our collective victory,” she says, surrounded by laughter and conversation. “It has changed our lives. It gives us hoe—for our children, for our health and for everything we have built together.”"

        "text_s": "At 14, Eugène learned he was HIV-positive. The diagnosis turned his adolescence upside down, marked by doubt, fear, and stigma. “At that age, you don’t understand everything, but you feel different. I was afraid of how others would see me, afraid of the future,” he confides. Now 20, he is a student at the Faculty of Education and advocates for self-acceptance and equitable access to reproductive health services for young people living with HIV.Eugène’s journey reflects the challenges faced by thousands of young people in Cameroon, where the fight against HIV remains a public health priority. In 2023, the country had around 490,500 people living with HIV, including 331,000 women. Young people aged 15 to 24 accounted for nearly 19% of new infections, with 2,228 cases recorded that year—a 49% drop compared to the 4,550 new infections reported in 2019. Despite the progress, challenges are many such as stigma, limited access to family planning services, and lack of youth-friendly information for HIV-positive adolescents.In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) plays a key role in providing technical and strategic support to the government. It assists the Ministry of Health in developing and disseminating guidelines that integrate sexual and reproductive health, family planning, and HIV care, while also supporting local NGOs working directly with young people.The national strategy focuses on promoting and protecting the rights of adolescents and young people to access sexual and reproductive health services, including contraception. It emphasizes integrating family planning services into HIV care sites, using age-specific approaches and combination prevention. In 2024, 52.7% of young people accessed modern family planning methods, up from 44.8% in 2023—a notable improvement, though still insufficient to fully meet needs.According to Dr Joseph Fokam, Executive Secretary of the National AIDS Control Committee, “this strategy aims to equip young people with the tools they need to make informed decisions about their sexual health in a safe and inclusive environment”. The goal is that by 2030, 90% of adolescents aged 10 to 24 will have the skills to protect themselves from HIV and STIs, while benefiting from tailored services.Eugène, who benefits from these services, shares his experience. “My perspective on family planning has changed a lot. I’m convinced that people living with HIV must do everything to avoid transmitting the virus. That’s why having an undetectable viral load and using condoms is so important”.Many challenges remain. Stigma and discrimination hinder access to services. Young people fear judgment when seeking contraceptives. Drug interactions between antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) and contraceptives are a concern, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare services is limited by geographic barriers. To address these barriers, the government, with support from WHO and other technical and financial partners, including German cooperation, has since 2022 established over 187 Care, Resource, and Activity Units (USRAs) across all 10 regions, with flexible hours and trained staff. Community service points have also been created to expand service coverage, among other measures.In this system, social workers play a key role. They are often the first point of contact for vulnerable youth, offering listening, guidance, and personalized support. Their presence helps build trust—essential for discussing sensitive topics like sexuality, contraception, or HIV.Edwige Eyenga, a social worker at Essos Hospital Center, shares a powerful story: a 19-year-old girl, pressured by her boyfriend to have a child, came to her for advice. After an educational talk, she decided against it, continued her studies, and earned her degree. She avoided early pregnancy by practicing abstinence. Between 2020 and 2024, Ms. Eyenga supported around 200 young people. She emphasizes the need to strengthen the capacities of service providers, create youth-friendly spaces, and ensure confidentiality.The future of the HIV response in Cameroon depends on synergy between institutional, community, and international actors. As a technical partner, WHO continues to strengthen policies, capacities, and services so that every young person living with HIV can live fully and confidently. “To be effective, services must be person-centered, respectful, confidential, and tailored to young people’s realities. This means training providers to better understand adolescents’ specific needs, reducing stigma-related barriers, and ensuring equitable access regardless of living environment. The approach must be holistic, inclusive, and sustainable,” says Dr Ngalame Alphonse Nyong, Programme Officer for Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent, and Elderly Health at WHO Cameroon.Between 2017 and 2024, significant progress was made toward achieving UNAIDS’ 95-95-95 targets. Knowledge of HIV status rose from 55.6% to 92%, reflecting improved testing. Treatment access remained high, reaching 96% in 2024, while viral suppression increased from 80.1% to 93%, indicating better adherence and quality of care. These results reflect positive momentum in the fight against HIV. However, to sustain and build on these gains, services must be adapted to the needs of the population—especially young people.Eugène, now 20, embodies this new generation of engaged youth. Thanks to the support he received, he regained confidence and can now envision a future. “I want to build a happy relationship, have children one day, and give them a future free of HIV. Today, I know it’s possible”.",

We share over a thousand kilometres of border and common populations. Many people transit through ports and other entry points. We have already experienced Ebola; we are highly exposed. It is essential to raise awareness among personnel at entry points,” says Dr Jean Claude Emeka, the Ministry of Health’s Director of Hygiene and Health Promotion.More than a thousand participants, including port health authorities, took part recently in an outbreak preparedness training session to bolster measures such as screening, early detection and handling of suspected cases.“Prevention is better than cure. We must not wait for the outbreak to reach us when it is already affecting our neighbour,” says Christian Voumina, Operations Manager at the main airport in the capital Brazzaville. “As the main entry point for international travellers, it is crucial that staff are informed about the disease and the measures to take. Ebola is one of the most dangerous diseases, so we must act early.”With support from World Health Organization (WHO), the health authorities have carried out an assessment of the national preparedness plan and are updating the National Ebola Preparedness and Response Plan. Public awareness materials to ensure health measures are observed by the population have also been developed and distributed.“We are on high alert,” says Emma Gisèle Monka, a health officer at Brazzaville’s Maya Maya International Airport. “I’m ready. I distribute information leaflets and what I’ve learned (in the training) enables me to respond to questions about symptoms, mode of transmission and preventive measures.”Disease surveillance and clinical care measures are also being strengthened. Isolation wards have been set aside at two main public hospitals in Brazzaville, while an ambulance has been stationed at the city’s main airport.The ongoing preparedness efforts mark a shift from a reactive to a proactive approach. By strengthening surveillance capacities, structuring coordination mechanisms and investing in staff training, health authorities, with support from partners, are working to build a resilient health system capable of responding not only to Ebola but any public health threat.“WHO stands with the government to strengthen capacities, ensure surveillance at entry points, and guarantee a rapid response in case of detection,” says Dr Vincent Sodjinou, WHO Representative in the Republic of Congo. “This commitment goes beyond Ebola. It is part of a comprehensive epidemic preparedness approach.

        "text_s": "Twenty-nine-year-old Aisha Nangobi is a midwife, a mother of two and a recent widow who has faced more adversity than most her age. Her husband, the first confirmed case in the recent Ebola virus disease outbreak in Uganda earlier in 2025, fell ill suddenly and died within ten days. “When I was told that there was an outbreak and that my husband had died of Ebola, it was really terrible to me,” says Nangobi. “Firstly, I lost my husband and secondly, he died of Ebola. Those two things were hard for me to handle.”Nangobi was the first contact to be admitted to the Ebola treatment centre. “Finding out you have Ebola, you are psychologically, physically, mentally gone… everything,” she says. Scared and confused, Aisha had to confront the situation on her own. When her 18-month-old son also tested positive, her strength and resolve were pushed to the limit. “But I had to care for him while I was still weak and sick myself,” she says.Then came the calls from the emergency response teams led by the Ministry of Health. Dr Chris Opesen, an anthropologist at WHO’s Uganda country office reassured Nangobi and told her about the survivors from the previous Ebola outbreak in 2022. “I didn’t believe him. I thought he was just trying to console me. But slowly, I began to cooperate,” recalls Nangobi. “I am really appreciative because I never thought that I would stand here again.”Nangobi is one of 10 survivors of this most recent outbreak who are part of Uganda’s National Ebola Survivor’s Programme, a Ministry of Health initiative supported by Baylor College of Medicine Children’s Foundation – Uganda and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The programme offers medical care, mental health support and psychosocial services to Ebola survivors.“In every outbreak, behind the statistics are real people – frightened, grieving and often stigmatized,” says Ayub Maswaswa, a mental health and psychosocial support professional and member of Uganda’s national Emergency Medical Team.Maswaswa, along with another 178 first responders trained by WHO and Ministry of Health, has been in the frontline of Uganda’s response to major disease outbreaks including Ebola, mpox and COVID-19.His work encompasses a wide range of psychosocial interventions. He has delivered psychological first aid, which provides immediate emotional support to people who have experienced a traumatic event or emergency. He has also conducted family therapy and facilitated group counselling sessions in some of the most affected regions of Uganda.His efforts have helped survivors reintegrate into their communities and he has also supported first responders who often face burnout and trauma. “My role is to help them find strength again,” says Maswaswa.These efforts are part of Uganda's Ebola virus disease recovery plan, which focuses on long-term survivor support, including counselling, health check-ups and reintegration into communities to address social and economic challenges that survivors face.“Some of the concerns we have right now as Ebola survivors is that some of our people lost jobs, those who are working part time in private and private-not-for-profit health facilities,” says Dr Ezra Mupakasa, an Ebola survivor and medical doctor at Saidina Abubakar hospital, just outside Kampala. “We need to create ways for people to make ends meet.”The plan also aims to strengthen national capacity, enhance disease surveillance and ensure sustained prevention and control measures to prevent future outbreaks and manage the health and psychosocial impact on communities.WHO has supported the Government of Uganda to strengthen its mental health and psychosocial support for health emergency response. This includes training health workers in the management of Ebola survivors, equipping them with the necessary skills to address both medical and psychosocial needs.WHO has also contributed to the review and improvement of standard operating procedures such as the livelihood assessment tool, which are essential for the effective implementation of survivor support programmes. In addition, WHO helped establish survivor clinics at three regional referral hospitals and one national referral hospital, ensuring continued access to specialized care for survivors close to their communities.To support the reintegration of Ebola survivors into their communities, WHO assisted with the preparation of discharge activities, including the procurement of admission and discharge packages, transportation back to communities and follow-up reviews within communities to monitor reintegration and address any emerging psychosocial challenges.“Surviving Ebola is much more than just being discharged from a treatment centre,” says Dr Kasonde Mwinga, WHO Representative in Uganda. “Survivors also need economic, psychosocial and mental health support as they navigate their new normal. WHO is proud to support these critical efforts as Uganda recovers from the Ebola outbreak.\"Slowly, a few friends who initially fled have returned and are helping Nangobi rebuild, providing accommodation, food and emotional support. She says she still breaks down, but she is determined to stay  for her two children. “I am grateful for the health workers who supported us in the treatment area, with counselling, and are helping us to resettle in our communities and gain our new lives,” she says.",

But slowly, I began to cooerate,” recalls Nangobi. “I am really areciative because I never thought that I would stand here again.”Nangobi is one of 10 survivors of this most recent outbreak who are art of Uganda’s National Ebola Survivor’s Programme, a Ministry of Health initiative suorted by Baylor College of Medicine Children’s Foundation – Uganda and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The rogramme offers medical care, mental health suort and sychosocial services to Ebola survivors.“In every outbreak, behind the statistics are real eole – frightened, grieving and often stigmatized,” says Ayub Maswaswa, a mental health and sychosocial suort rofessional and member of Uganda’s national Emergency Medical Team.Maswaswa, along with another 178 first resonders trained by WHO and Ministry of Health, has been in the frontline of Uganda’s resonse to major disease outbreaks including Ebola, mox and COVID-19.His work encomasses a wide range of sychosocial interventions. He has delivered sychological first aid, which rovides immediate emotional suort to eole who have exerienced a traumatic event or emergency. He has also conducted family theray and facilitated grou counselling sessions in some of the most affected regions of Uganda.His efforts have heled survivors reintegrate into their communities and he has also suorted first resonders who often face burnout and trauma. “My role is to hel them find strength again,” says Maswaswa.These efforts are art of Uganda's Ebola virus disease recovery lan, which focuses on long-term survivor suort, including counselling, health check-us and reintegration into communities to address social and economic challenges that survivors face.“Some of the concerns we have right now as Ebola survivors is that some of our eole lost jobs, those who are working art time in rivate and rivate-not-for-rofit health facilities,” says Dr Ezra Muakasa, an Ebola survivor and medical doctor at Saidina Abubakar hosital, just outside Kamala. “We need to create ways for eole to make ends meet.”The lan also aims to strengthen national caacity, enhance disease surveillance and ensure sustained revention and control measures to revent future outbreaks and manage the health and sychosocial imact on communities.WHO has suorted the Government of Uganda to strengthen its mental health and sychosocial suort for health emergency resonse. This includes training health workers in the management of Ebola survivors, equiing them with the necessary skills to address both medical and sychosocial needs.WHO has also contributed to the review and imrovement of standard oerating rocedures such as the livelihood assessment tool, which are essential for the effective imlementation of survivor suort rogrammes. In addition, WHO heled establish survivor clinics at three regional referral hositals and one national referral hosital, ensuring continued access to secialized care for survivors close to their communities.To suort the reintegration of Ebola survivors into their communities, WHO assisted with the rearation of discharge activities, including the rocurement of admission and discharge ackages, transortation back to communities and follow-u reviews within communities to monitor reintegration and address any emerging sychosocial challenges.“Surviving Ebola is much more than just being discharged from a treatment centre,” says Dr Kasonde Mwinga, WHO Reresentative in Uganda. “Survivors also need economic, sychosocial and mental health suort as they navigate their new normal. WHO is roud to suort these critical efforts as Uganda recovers from the Ebola outbreak.\"Slowly, a few friends who initially fled have returned and are heling Nangobi rebuild, roviding accommodation, food and emotional suort. She says she still breaks down, but she is determined to stay strong for her two children. “I am grateful for the health workers who suorted us in the treatment area, with counselling, and are heling us to resettle in our communities and gain our new lives,” she says."

        "text_s": "Every year on October 10, World Mental Health Day reminds us of the vital role mental health plays—especially in times of crisis. At Virunga General Referral Hospital in eastern DRC, clinical psychologist Annie Kahambu Kikoli has spent the past three years helping people heal. She shares her journey, the challenges she faces, and what keeps her going.What are the most common psychological disorders among people in emergency situations?In my daily work, I support patients facing a wide range of psychological disorders. Anxiety is one of the most common, as is post-traumatic stress. Some relive their trauma through nightmares; others develop hypervigilance—a state of constant alertness, as if danger could strike at any moment, even when it’s not present. Many fall into deep depression; they feel abandoned, lose all hope, and no longer find any joy in life.Social isolation is also very common, especially among people whose body image has been altered, such as those who have undergone amputations. They often prefer to isolate themselves, to hide from others. I also see people with concentration issues and difficulties adapting… These are all invisible but very real forms of suffering.How do you adapt your therapeutic approach to these specific needs?Each person is unique, and I always strive to tailor my approach to their needs. I usually begin with individual therapy, which helps to better understand the patient’s symptoms and expectations. This step lays the foundation for deeper work and helps build a relationship of trust. When necessary—or when a patient could benefit from a collective dynamic—I offer group therapy. These sessions are particularly enriching; they allow participants to feel less alone in their struggles, to relate to others’ stories, and to draw comfort and strength from that solidarity.What are the most difficult aspects of your work?This profession is deeply human, but also emotionally demanding. Managing emotions is one of the biggest challenges. Listening to traumatic stories every day eventually takes a toll. I sometimes come home feeling completely drained.Building trust with patients is also not always easy. Some are wary or closed off, and it can take time. The complexity of cases is another challenge: every story is different; every pain is unique. Then there’s long-term follow-up. Some patients can’t return, move to another region, or miss appointments. That makes our work even harder.What role does psychological support play in recovery and resilience?Psychological support plays a vital role in recovery and resilience. It provides a space to express emotions and helps prevent more serious disorders like PTSD. By working on both emotional and practical aspects of daily life, we help patients regain a sense of balance and control. Healing the body is not enough: we must also care for the mind to achieve full recovery.What keeps you going in your work? Can you share a story that touched you?What motivates me every day is seeing my patients getting better. Every small step forward, every smile regained reminds me that my work has meaning. I also value the educational role of psychology, which is still little known or misunderstood in some communities. Every session is an opportunity to raise awareness and help people discover their inner strength.Among the many stories of patients I’ve supported, one of a 15-year-old girl often comes to mind. She arrived at the hospital in critical condition after experiencing extreme violence and losing her family. She no longer wanted to live. Through intensive psychological support, she gradually regained confidence, began to smile again, and started imagining a future. She wanted to honor her mother’s memory and fight for her. Upon discharge, we found someone she trusted to take her in. She told us she felt reborn. Stories like this remind me why I do this work.What’s your message for World Mental Health Day?Mental health must be a priority, especially in crisis contexts. Psychologists need support to continue helping others without burning out. It would be helpful to have regular opportunities to gather with fellow professionals, to share, decompress, and refocus. This would be a concrete way to recognize our role and strengthen our ability to act. Fully integrating mental health into humanitarian responses means addressing suffering where it is often silent.",

        "text_s": "Nigeria has revitalized mental health policy and programmes in the last three years. Dr Tunde Massey-Ferguson Ojo, a psychiatrist, global mental health expert and National Mental Health Programme coordinator, is driving this progress. His guiding principle: “There is no health without mental health.”Dr Ojo sheds more light on the country’s progress, why mental health response in emergencies is critical, and his vision is moving forward.What has been the recent progress on mental health in Nigeria?Quite a lot has happened in the past three years. Mental health has gained real traction – both from what we’re doing as government and from global trends. With more conversations happening through globalization and social media, there’s now a broader understanding of mental health, especially among young people.At government level, we’ve seen major milestones. In 2022 we reviewed the 2013 National Policy on Mental Health Service Delivery and replaced it with the 2023 National Mental Health Policy. The old policy focused narrowly on service delivery, but the new one takes a broader public health perspective. We also developed Nigeria’s first National Suicide Prevention Strategic Framework, aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals on noncommunicable diseases and mental health.Importantly, this work was strengthened by the signing of the 2021 National Mental Health Act, which received presidential assent in December 2022 after  advocacy and collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO) and partners. The act provided a solid legal foundation for policy and action. It specifically calls for a national suicide prevention strategy, which we have since developed, and guides our work on mental health governance.One of our priorities has been the decriminalization of attempted suicide. Nigeria is among the few countries that still criminalize this act and we believe this must change. The government has established a National Task Force on the Decriminalization of Attempted Suicide and we are now working closely with the Office of the Attorney-General to finalize a draft amendment bill. We expect tangible progress very soon.We have also taken an integrated approach to mental health. It is now embedded within programmes on neglected tropical diseases and HIV and WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) 3.0 framework has been contextualized and endorsed by Nigeria’s National Council on Health. Any partner seeking to integrate mental health into their work can now build on that.We also found that very few states had mental health leadership for. So we pushed for the creation of mental health units within every state’s Department of Public Health. Today, 27 out of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory have established such units, a big step towards strengthening coordination across the country.What is the perception of mental health among the Nigerian public?There’s growing awareness that there’s no health without mental health. That phrase, once just a statement, has become a reality. More people and programmes now recognize that mental health is integral to overall wellbeing.Attitudes are changing. However, stigma and discrimination remain our biggest barriers. Beyond resources or infrastructure, the root challenge often lies in societal attitudes. The conversation is improving, people are more open to talk about mental health, but there’s still a long way to go before stigma is truly reduced.Why is it important to integrate mental health into emergency preparedness, response and recovery, particularly in Nigeria?The treatment gap for mental health in low- and middle-income countries is already high – between 65% and 90% – and it becomes even greater during emergencies. Conflict, displacement and trauma all disrupt services and family life, while increasing the risk of developing new mental health conditions or worsening existing ones.In Nigeria, conflict and insecurity, particularly in the northeast, have displaced over 3.2 million people. These communities face enormous psychosocial needs. We’ve worked to strengthen mental health and psychosocial support in these settings using the WHO mhGAP Humanitarian Intervention Guide. Unfortunately, as resources decline, many partners are scaling down activities.Our goal is a more responsive and sustainable system that can be activated not only in humanitarian crises but also in epidemic and pandemic responses.What is your vision for the next few years of Nigeria’s mental health response?We want to transform Nigeria’s mental health landscape. Our goal is universal health coverage that truly includes mental health – where people no longer must pay out of pocket for care. Currently, fewer than 3% of people with mental health conditions are covered by health insurance.We expect the decriminalization of attempted suicide to open access to care and strengthen data collection and surveillance. We’re also working to ensure mental health indicators are included in the National Health Management Information System and to build a data-driven approach to planning and service delivery.Nigeria has never had a costed national mental health plan and that’s a gap we’re closing. Alongside the new policy, we’re developing a clear, funded action plan.Ultimately, we want to see a Nigeria where mental health is promoted from childhood, supported across sectors, in schools, workplaces and communities, and addressed through prevention and treatment. With collaboration and commitment, I believe we are moving in the right direction.",

This comes as the Democratic Republic of the Congo enters its fifth week of Ebola outbreak response in Kasai Province in the central region of the country.WHO and partners have supported the Ministry of Health to conduct a review of the current Ebola situation in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo to evaluate the likelihood of cross border spread to Uganda. Using WHO’s standardized risk assessment approach, the team reviewed potential health hazards posed by the outbreak, including the cause, severity and risk of illness or death. The assessment also covered contextual factors including the outbreak’s current location, economic activities of local communities, population movement patterns, the current outbreak response in the DRC and the likelihood of importation into Uganda. Based on available information, the overall risk was assessed as moderate and 11 districts were identified as high risk.Based on these findings, the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners reviewed and updated the country’s Ebola virus disease contingency plan. The plan builds on lessons from previous Ebola outbreaks and draws from Uganda’s ongoing Sudan virus disease recovery plan. It also draws on critical gaps and lessons from a recent simulation exercises.Health authorities have strengthened screening of travellers at 22 points of entry and at Entebbe International Airport. The Public Health Emergency Operations Centre has been put on alert and is actively monitoring the situation. International Organization for Migration is supporting efforts to map population movements, to better understand potential transmission routes.“Uganda remains vigilant and proactive. Our strengthened surveillance, updated contingency plans and trained emergency teams reflect our unwavering commitment to safeguarding public health across borders,” says Dr Charles Olaro, Director General Health Services at Uganda’s Ministry of Health.In May 2025, Uganda hosted more than 50 participants from 13 other countries in East Africa for a three-day joint simulation on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. The training focused on case management, water, sanitation and hygiene measures, infection prevention and control, and logistics. The simulation exercises took place inside the Infectious Diseases Treatment Module, an innovative, rapidly deployable medical facility used in infectious disease outbreak response.The module is an innovation of WHO and World Food Programme (WFP)’s five-year INITIATE² plan, which brings together emergency response actors, as well as research and academic institutions, to develop innovative and standardized solutions and training to support readiness and response capabilities in health emergencies.In July 2025, WHO, with funding from the European Union, supported Uganda’s Ministry of Health to conduct a full-scale simulation exercise aimed at strengthening Uganda’s emergency health response capabilities. Seventy-five emergency medical team members and uniformed personnel participated in the simulation. The scenario replicated the detection, investigation and response to a localized Ebola outbreak and included practicalexercises in all pillars of outbreak response, including psychosocial support and safe and dignified burials.The most recent outbreak of Ebola in Uganda was declared on 30 January 2025. According to official data, 14 Ebola cases were recorded, 12 confirmed and two probable. Four people died and 10 recovered. More than 500 contacts were identified and monitored. The outbreak was declared over on 26 April 2025.This was the country’s second Ebola event in less than three years.“Uganda’s rapid and coordinated response is thanks to its long-standing expertise in outbreak control,” says Dr Kasonde Mwinga, WHO Representative in Uganda. “WHO will continue to support the Ministry of Health to leverage its experience to prepare for future threats.”At a broader level, WHO has assessed the overall public health risk from the outbreak in the DRC as high at national level, moderate at regional level and low globally. WHO is working with authorities in ten neighbouring countries to initiate readiness assessments and contingency planning.",

Our strengthened surveillance, udated contingency lans and trained emergency teams reflect our unwavering commitment to safeguarding ublic health across borders,” says Dr Charles Olaro, Director General Health Services at Uganda’s Ministry of Health.In May 2025, Uganda hosted more than 50 articiants from 13 other countries in East Africa for a three-day joint simulation on infectious disease outbreak rearedness and resonse. The training focused on case management, water, sanitation and hygiene measures, infection revention and control, and logistics. The simulation exercises took lace inside the Infectious Diseases Treatment Module, an innovative, raidly deloyable medical facility used in infectious disease outbreak resonse.The module is an innovation of WHO and World Food Programme (WFP)’s five-year INITIATE² lan, which brings together emergency resonse actors, as well as research and academic institutions, to develo innovative and standardized solutions and training to suort readiness and resonse caabilities in health emergencies.In July 2025, WHO, with funding from the Euroean Union, suorted Uganda’s Ministry of Health to conduct a full-scale simulation exercise aimed at strengthening Uganda’s emergency health resonse caabilities. Seventy-five emergency medical team members and uniformed ersonnel articiated in the simulation. The scenario relicated the detection, investigation and resonse to a localized Ebola outbreak and included racticalexercises in all illars of outbreak resonse, including sychosocial suort and safe and dignified burials.The most recent outbreak of Ebola in Uganda was declared on 30 January 2025. According to official data, 14 Ebola cases were recorded, 12 confirmed and two robable. Four eole died and 10 recovered. More than 500 contacts were identified and monitored. The outbreak was declared over on 26 Aril 2025.This was the country’s second Ebola event in less than three years.“Uganda’s raid and coordinated resonse is thanks to its long-standing exertise in outbreak control,” says Dr Kasonde Mwinga, WHO Reresentative in Uganda. “WHO will continue to suort the Ministry of Health to leverage its exerience to reare for future threats.”At a broader level, WHO has assessed the overall ublic health risk from the outbreak in the DRC as high at national level, moderate at regional level and low globally. WHO is working with authorities in ten neighbouring countries to initiate readiness assessments and contingency lanning."
