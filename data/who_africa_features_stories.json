        "text_s": "Andra Chigova, a 10-year-old girl from Windhoek, Namibia, is encouraging other girls to get vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes most cervical cancers. “I just got my HPV vaccination today. Do not be scared ‒ the HPV vaccine will protect us in the future against cervical cancer,” she says.Chigova is one of the thousands of girls who have received the HPV vaccine through the national campaign launched by the Ministry of Health and Social Services in August 2025, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners. The campaign targets around 232 000 girls aged 9 to 14 years across all 14 regions of Namibia. During the initial two weeks of the campaign, which ran from 4‒15 August 2025, around 65 000 girls were vaccinated.Chigova’s parents educated her about the importance of the vaccine and how it will protect her from cervical cancer as she grows older. “Nothing makes me happier than knowing my daughter is now protected from cervical cancer,” says her mother, Temptation Chigova. “I have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact this disease has on women, their families and entire communities. I am truly grateful to the Government of Namibia for ensuring that our daughters will not have to endure the same pain.”Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with an estimated 660 000 new cases in 2022. Almost 94% of the 350 000 cervical cancer deaths that year occurred in low- and middle-income countries.The disease remains a pressing public health challenge in Namibia, with an estimated 350 new cases and more than 200 deaths each year. To address this, Namibia has aligned with WHO’s Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer, which sets ambitious targets: vaccinating 90% of girls against HPV by age 15; screening 70% of women by ages 35 and 45; and ensuring 90% of women with cervical cancer disease receive timely treatment. The national HPV vaccination campaign is key to Namibia’s strategy to reduce the burden of cervical cancer.According to Ramona Mbadeka, a nurse at Groot Aub Clinic on the outskirts of Windhoek, health workers are reaching out to parents to provide information and dispel any misinformation about the vaccine. “Some parents who initially refused to allow their daughters to be vaccinated later consented after attending an information session on the vaccine,” he says. “The vaccine is voluntary and I encourage parents to educate themselves with accurate information.”Dr Esperance Luvindao, Minister of Health and Social Services in Namibia, reiterates that the vaccine is safe and effective. “We are seeing far too many women affected by this preventable illness. The numbers speak for themselves,” she says. “We welcome questions and are here to provide accurate information so families can make informed decisions based on facts, not fear or misinformation.”Before and during the two-week campaign WHO worked with health authorities to provide supportive supervision to monitor progress at service delivery points, including health facilities and schools. The Organization supported a technical mission to strengthen planning, logistics, training and community engagement, addressing misinformation and operational gaps. In addition, WHO supported the development of the National HPV Vaccine Introduction Plan and the vaccination communication strategy. As part of its risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) efforts, WHO contributed to the development of information materials, media monitoring and the delivery of training modules for health workers, regional RCCE officers and community health workers.“The ongoing HPV vaccination campaign aims to prevent infection, protect health and save the lives of our young girls from cervical cancer in the years to come,” says Dr Richard Banda, WHO Representative in Namibia. “I congratulate the Government of Namibia in this milestone in its public health journey.”For Chigova, the campaign is not just about numbers but rather the promise of a healthy future for herself and her peers. “Now I feel happy because I know I am protected,” she says.",

        "text_s": "In an important step to reduce maternal mortality, Guinea-Bissau has launched its first-ever national guidelines for maternal health, focused on improving care before, during and after childbirth.The Ministry of Health, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, led the development of this new national framework to guide maternal health services. The goal is to curb maternal deaths, estimated to be about 500 per 100 000 live births. Under the Sustainable Development Goals maternal mortality reduction targets, countries should aim to lower maternal deaths to under 70 per 100 000 live births.Guinea-Bissau has not had standard clinical protocols for maternal care. This made it difficult to provide consistent, high-quality services and contributed to avoidable deaths among mothers and newborns.“One of the major gaps in our health system has been the absence of standardized norms for maternal and child care. Each region, facility and health worker has been providing care in their own way,” says Dr Elizio Junior Baldé Ferreira, Gynecologist-Obstetrician and Director of Sexual and Reproductive Health Service at the Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP), Guinea-Bissau.“For the first time, we now have national standards for prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care that will guide all maternity care providers and will certainly facilitate the monitoring of quality of care throughout the national territory,” adds Dr Baldé.In Guinea-Bissau, around 81% of pregnant women attend at least four antenatal care visits, but only around 50% of all births are assisted by skilled health workers. Skilled support is critical to detect risks early, manage complications and ensure safe delivery. Without it, common issues like heavy bleeding, infections or high blood pressure can quickly become life-threatening. Yet, many women still face barriers to accessing the care they need throughout pregnancy and childbirth.WHO recommends eight antenatal visits to better protect the health of mothers and newborns. The country is working to meet this target and increase the number of births that take place in health facilities under professional care.Health experts, nurses, government agencies and partners worked together to develop and validate the new guidelines. The document defines essential medicines, clinical procedures and key service indicators for maternal care. It also lays the foundation for training health workers, strengthening supervision and improving service delivery across the country.The Ministry of Health approved the new approach following the launch of its National Health Strategy Plan 2023–2028. The plan also calls for more policies for expanding and integrating reproductive, maternal, newborn child and adolescent health services across the country.WHO supported the Ministry of Health throughout the process, providing technical expertise to align the guidelines with global best practices. The Organization coordinated partner engagement, facilitated validation and led advocacy efforts to promote national ownership and long-term impact.“The assessment tool developed by WHO provided a clear picture of how existing practices on the ground align with WHO recommendations,\" said Dr Daisy Trovoada, specialist in reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent from WHO Regional Office for Africa. \"It also helped identify priority actions for the national guidelines for improving antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care.”Health authorities have begun using the new standards in the regions of Bolama in the southwest, Farim in the north-central region, and Gabu in the east. In the next months, they will train and supervise health workers to improve care, help more women attend the recommended eight antenatal visits and support safer births in health facilities.This new framework is also helping partners better plan and provide the medical equipment needed for quality care and support training, supervision and better health services.“By setting clear health standards and strengthening services, Guinea-Bissau is working to lower the number of maternal deaths and improving life expectancy across the population,” says Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, Acting WHO Representative in Guinea-Bissau. “We are proud to stand with the Ministry of Health in building a er, more equitable health system for all.”These efforts directly support the Sustainable Development Goals, by helping reduce maternal and newborn deaths and moving closer to universal access to quality health care. As Guinea-Bissau continues rolling out the new standards, sustained investment, coordination and training will be essential to improve outcomes and ensure that more women and babies receive the care they need ‒ before, during and after birth.",

But the symptoms worsened, revealing a cholera infection. \"I didn’t understand what was happening to me. The pain started mildly, then became unbearable. I had stomach aches, fever, and felt very weak. I thought it was normal after childbirth. I didn’t think it was an illness.\"Since July 26, 2025, the Republic of Congo has been facing a cholera outbreak that has affected over 430 people and caused 34 deaths. The most affected age group is between 15 to 24 years old, and the hardest-hit areas are Mbamou Island, Talangaï in Brazzaville Department, and Mossaka-Loukolela in Congo-Oubangui Department.Upon the official declaration of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO), working with the government and partners quickly activated its Incident Management System (IMST) and supported the deployment of three multidisciplinary teams to priority areas. These teams helped structure the response, confirm cases, and strengthen national capacities in close collaboration with field actors.WHO’s support included the delivery of 7 tons of cholera medicines and kits, the establishment of treatment centers in Mbamou, Mossaka, and Talangaï, training of 172 health workers in case management and infection prevention, and the education of 250 community relays on preventive measures. WHO also provided a speedboat to facilitate transport between Mbamou Island and Brazzaville, enhanced surveillance at entry points, and supported the disinfection of 61 wells and several health facilities.On the ground, health professionals witnessed improvements, thanks to this support. Dr Nelson Bokale, the chief medical officer of Mbamou Island’s health district, recalls the difficult beginning. \"For nearly five years, I’ve faced many challenges, but the cholera outbreak response was particularly significant. Before the support arrived, we did what we could with available resources. The arrival of the Surge support team was a turning point. It strengthened our efforts and allowed us to organize a more structured response,\" he emphasized.WHO also supported epidemiological surveillance, active case finding, and the setup of water circuits for treatment units. Experts in infectious diseases, logistics, hygiene, water and sanitation, and risk communication were also mobilized. Thanks to these joint efforts, the outbreak’s dynamics have shifted, and indicators are improving. On Mbamou Island in particular, the fatality rate was halved, dropping from 11.7% to 4.8% within two weeks. As of August 15, 2025, of the 12 active cases on the island, 5 are hospitalized while the other 7 are receiving outpatient care.During a field visit, Dr Vincent Dossou Sodjinou, WHO Representative in Congo, described the progress with optimism. \"The trend of the outbreak is declining. Health workers are active, treatment centers are operational, and communities are better informed. We commend the collaboration between the government and WHO, which enabled a rapid and effective response,\" he stated.Partner complemented WHO’s efforts by repairing boreholes, distributing water purification tablets to more than 1,300 households, and installing handwashing stations in affected area. Awareness campaigns have since reached thousands of families to strengthen adherence to preventive measures.Now recovered, Angèle is an advocate and actively involved in community awareness. \"I tell everyone in the community that if they have symptoms, they shouldn’t stay home.

This year's theme, “Strengthening global solidarity and empowering local communities,” focused on recognizing the critical role of local actors in humanitarian response.Abidine Ould Sidewa, a nurse at Mbera refugee camp in Mauritania, describes his contribution in protecting the vulnerable and providing for people in need of humanitarian assistance.1. What led you to be involved in humanitarian work? What is your role at the Mberra camp triage centre?I started as a trader in Timbuktu (in Mali), but it was when I discovered community health work that I truly understood what it meant, such as being helpful, listening and supporting others. This is what inspired me to train as a nurse in 1998. Since then, I have been committed to serving all people in need, regardless of their origin.Since April 2024, I have been working at the triage centre for new arrivals from Mali. We provide consultations, malnutrition screening, vaccinations for zero-dose children and awareness-raising. This system enables us to identify individuals who are ill before they integrate into the community, which has significantly reduced community deaths.2. What are the common diseases you handle and how do you raise awareness among communities?In the field, I deal with diseases that mainly affect children and women: acute respiratory infections, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, measles and, mostly, malnutrition. These conditions are often worsened by a lack of access to healthcare, safe drinking water and a balanced diet.To raise awareness among the population, I take a tailored approach for each context. I talk to mothers, community leaders and young people. I inform them about the importance of vaccination, simple hygiene practices, the risks associated with births unattended by a skilled health worker, and the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding. I also rely on community leaders and dialogue sessions to convey messages clearly and respectfully. I always emphasize the importance of following vaccination schedule, as it saves lives.3. Can you tell us about any incident that has stayed with?In 2022. I met a pregnant refugee woman, alone with two young children, both suffering from severe malnutrition. She was distrustful, exhausted and refused treatment for religious reasons. I took the time to listen to her, to understand her fears and beliefs. It wasn't easy, but little by little, she began to trust me.I arranged for her to be transferred to a health centre, organized nutritional care for her children, and accompanied her throughout her journey, right up to delivery. She gave birth to a healthy baby. That day, she thanked me emotionally. It brough tears to my eyes.4. What progress give you confidence in the future of local humanitarian action?I see real transformation: communities are becoming aware of their role, asking questions and getting involved. Collaboration with the police, the structured reception of new arrivals, and growing interest in health show that humanitarian work is no longer limited to emergencies. It is becoming a driver of recovery and empowerment.For me, reaching the most vulnerable is not just about providing care or resources. Above all, it means recognizing their humanity and their fundamental right to live in safety, in good health and with hope. Humanitarian aid begins when we refuse to look away. By strengthening the capacity of local communities to care for themselves, we are not only saving lives: we are planting the seeds of a more equitable, dignified and united future.",

Within days, breathing difficulties and the tell-tale thick grey coating in some throats confirmed an outbreak of diphtheria.In a densely populated refugee setting with limited health infrastructure, even a handful of cases could quickly spiral into crisis. Mauritania’s Ministry of Health, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and humanitarian partners, moved fast. Within 72 hours of laboratory confirmation, a full outbreak response was under way.Between July and September 2024, at least ten cases of diphtheria, including two deaths, were recorded in the Mberra camp. Of these cases, eight were in children, six of whom were under five years of age, all of whom were unvaccinated. In response, more than a thousand people were vaccinated, including nearly 70 health professionals.In addition, over two tonnes of emergency supplies were delivered to the camp, including antitoxins, antibiotics, personal protective equipment and disinfectants. WHO deployed technical experts to support case investigation, contact tracing and coordination with national and local teams. Community health workers were rapidly trained to identify symptoms, isolate cases and provide prevention education to families.“Before the training, many of us had never seen a case of diphtheria,” says Fatou, a community health volunteer. “Now we know what to look for, and how to respond.”A targeted risk communication and community engagement campaign used megaphones, posters and local radio in multiple languages to build trust, educate communities and ensure early reporting of symptoms.Thanks to this rapid, coordinated approach, the outbreak was contained within weeks. No deaths were reported, and all cases remained confined to the initial cluster.\"This was a textbook example of what rapid mobilization and partnership can achieve,\" says Dr Charlotte Faty Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Mauritania. \"In a fragile setting like Mberra, early action saved lives.\"The experience underlined the importance of preparedness, coordination and community engagement in humanitarian contexts. WHO and partners, working hand-in-hand with Mauritania’s Ministry of Health, turned a looming health emergency into an example of public health equity in action.Awareness-raising campaigns were carried out in communities and among humanitarian personnel to encourage vaccination, with a particular focus on diphtheria prevention. Between July 2024 to May 2025, more than 2300 newly arrived individuals at Mberra camp were vaccinated.",

Within days, breathing difficulties and the tell-tale thick grey coating in some throats confirmed an outbreak of dihtheria.In a densely oulated refugee setting with limited health infrastructure, even a handful of cases could quickly siral into crisis. Mauritania’s Ministry of Health, suorted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and humanitarian artners, moved fast. Within 72 hours of laboratory confirmation, a full outbreak resonse was under way.Between July and Setember 2024, at least ten cases of dihtheria, including two deaths, were recorded in the Mberra cam. Of these cases, eight were in children, six of whom were under five years of age, all of whom were unvaccinated.

Until recently, a medical emergency in the Mberra refugee camp meant a race against time.With the nearest hospital in Bassiknou, over 60 kilometres away, and no available ambulance, pregnant women and critically-ill patients were forced to make the journey on motorcycles and donkey carts, often with tragic results.That changed early this year when Mauritania’s Ministry of Health, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, deployed a fully equipped ambulance to Mberra camp. Staffed by trained personnel, the ambulance is enabling timely referrals, especially for obstetric emergencies and trauma cases.“Before, we feared the worst.

Patients are reaching care in time, and outcomes are improving.”In the first few months, the ambulance facilitated a host of emergency referrals, improving survival rates and reinforcing community trust in the health system. It complements broader WHO support to strengthen health services in the camp, including capacity-building for staff, improved supply chains and disease surveillance.This intervention is part of WHO’s ongoing efforts to reinforce emergency preparedness and resilient health systems in fragile and humanitarian settings, saving lives, preserving dignity and advancing health for all.“We are committed to ensuring that, even in fragile settings such as this one, everyone can count on lifesaving health services,” says Dr Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Mauritania. “Every life saved is a reminder of what timely response and partnership can achieve.”",

        "text_s": "In an effort to address severely limited access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services in South Sudan, the Ministry of Health, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, has been implementing several initiatives to expand access in seven of its 10 states.Years of overlapping humanitarian crises, including infectious disease outbreaks and complex humanitarian crises driven by conflict and climate-related disasters have disrupted health systems, limiting access to essential health services, including SRHR.As a result, South Sudan continues to face some of the gravest SRHR challenges globally. Access to family planning is low, with a modern contraceptive prevalence rate of around 6% and an adolescent birth rate of 97 per 1000 girls between aged 15‒19 years.The country’s maternal mortality ratio is estimated at 692 deaths per 100 000 live births, with around 10% linked to complications from unsafe abortion. The country’s legislation permits abortion only when the mother’s life is at risk. Despite these legal constraints, women may seek unsafe abortion services, often arriving at health facilities with severe post-abortion complications.With only around 40% of births attended by skilled birth attendants, other key contributors to maternal mortality include postpartum haemorrhage, obstructed labour and sepsis ‒ all of which are preventable with timely access to quality health care.Health authorities, with support from WHO and partners, have focused on expanding access to care that responds to people’s needs, choices and rights, through resilient primary health systems. This has been done by strengthening coordination, training health workers and improving monitoring. Targeted efforts have focused on equipping health workers with the knowledge and skills they need to deliver better care.In the northwestern states of Warrap and Northern Bahr el Ghazal, in 2024, 50 health workers were trained in maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response, an important step toward strengthening how maternal and newborn deaths are identified, reported and addressed.An additional 50 health workers were trained in family planning in Torit and Wau, expanding access to voluntary contraceptive services in primary health centres. In Torit, Malakal, Renk and Wau states, 94 health workers received specialized training in the clinical management of rape, ensuring that survivors of gender-based violence from refugee, returnee and host communities can access timely, compassionate care.“The training has also enabled me to diagnose patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. It has really expanded my knowledge and allowing me to assist many mothers,” says Faida Jackline, a 29-year-old midwife from Kator Primary Health Care Centre in Juba.Improving access to services also means working with communities to create demand and address stigma and misinformation. Because SRHR services have been absent in the past, many people do not know that they are available. Through dialogues, more than 540 local and religious leaders across five states have been oriented on the concepts underpinning SRHR, helping to increase awareness and promote greater use of available services among communities.WHO has supported the development of national post-abortion care guidelines, recognizing the critical role of safe and timely post-abortion care in preventing maternal deaths. The new guidelines focus on the management of complications from both spontaneous and unsafe abortions.Around 15 health workers from selected primary health care facilities were trained in the new guidelines and at least 30% of the 35 targeted health centres have been equipped with the necessary tools and supplies to deliver post-abortion care, including manual vacuum aspirators, beds, speculums and consumables.“In collaboration with WHO, we have been able to successfully implement cervical cancer screening and post-abortion care management in six health facilities within Juba County. We have trained 14 midwives, who are currently doing excellent job screening patients in these six facilities. We sincerely thank WHO and partners for this collaboration,” says Vivian Hawa, Reproductive Health Coordinator at Central Equatoria State’s Ministry of Health.During 2024, the first year of the project 934 women accessed care for post-abortion complications. This includes 68 health clients from primary health facilities, which initially never had the capacity to provide post-abortion care services.“Previously we never use to provide post-abortion care at this facility, especially manual vacuum aspiration. However, after receiving the training in 2024, we are now able to attend to women who have had unsafe abortions and perform other post-abortion care procedures,” says Kenyi Emmanuel Wani, a 27-year-old midwife from Munuki Primary Healthcare Centre in Juba, the country’s capital.As the programme is ending its second year, continued collaboration and investment will be essential to build on these early gains and contribute to longer-term improvements in reproductive health outcomes across the country.“Access to quality SRHR services is a matter of dignity, rights, and resilience. South Sudan is making important strides to allow women and girls to gain access to the care they need,” says Dr Humphrey Karamagi, WHO Representative to South Sudan. “WHO is proud to support the Ministry of Health in strengthening the health system and ensuring that no one is left behind.”",

        "text_s": "Mpox continues to strain the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s health system. Between 1 January and 31 May 2025, the country reported more than 12 000 suspected cases and 22 deaths, accounting for over 50% of all mpox cases in Africa this year.In response, World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are supporting the country’s efforts to strengthen clinical care, improve detection and build the skills and engagement of frontline responders.GOARN, a network coordinated by WHO that supports countries respond to health emergencies by deploying personnel and resources, mobilized seven specialists to support Democratic Republic of the Congo’s mpox response. Working both on the ground and remotely from Nairobi, the team provided expertise in treatment, data analysis, epidemiology, and disease surveillance.Among them was Dr Andre Basilua Muzembo, a case management specialist from the University of Hyogo in Japan. Over nearly two months, he worked with health professionals at national level and WHO teams covering logistics, infection prevention, vaccination, and mpox response to ensure effective coordination.At Clinique Kinoise, Kinshasa’s main referral centre for severe mpox cases, he provided support to help address critical challenges. The facility, with 42 beds and an average of 20 patients, operated with just around five out of 95 staff trained on mpox management. Chronic shortages of gloves, medicines, and essential equipment, combined with limited access to laboratory testing and difficult working conditions, contributed to a mortality rate of around 10%.During more than 30 visits to five mpox treatment centres across Kinshasa, mainly in Clinique Kinoise, he mentored staff in compassionate care, worked with colleagues to improve hygiene practices and helped coordinate delivery of medicines and medical supplies. He also worked closely with Kokolo, Vijana, Masina Cinquantenaire and Kinkole treatment centres to streamline referrals and maintain continuity of care.The response team placed special attention to high-risk groups, including children, pregnant women, and people living with HIV. Some pregnant patients arrived with foetal deaths, partly due to difficulties in accessing essential diagnostic tools such as ultrasound. In collaboration with the National AIDS Control Programme (PNMLS) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), at least five HIV-Mpox co-infected patients were referred for specialized treatment.When two mpox cases were detected in a Kinshasa orphanage, an emergency vaccination reached 30 people at risk. Alerts on cases of infected prisoners at Kokolo Hospital, followed by more than 30 cases reported at Ndolo prison, underscored the need for sustained outreach in vulnerable settings.As part of efforts to strengthen the health system beyond the immediate response, 59 front-line workers, including 27 doctors and 32 nurses from the Clinique Kinoise received training in clinical management of mpox.Heavy flooding then complicated the outbreak response, requiring a more coordinated and multisectoral efforts. Response teams faced overlapping emergencies—managing mpox and cholera while supporting displaced communities. At four evacuation sites, including Stade Tata Raphaël and Bandalungwa, WHO and partners delivered essential supplies such as medicines, cholera kits, and hygiene items.\"Despite extremely difficult working conditions, I witnessed how important it was to work to save lives with determination, compassion and team spirit. Resilience is not just about coping with adversity, it's about living through it with those affected, listening to those on the edge of despair and doing what we can with even the most modest of means,\" says Dr Muzembo.These deployments are possible thanks to the support of UK public health rapid support team, Public health agency of Canada, Research institute of nursing care for people and community, University of Hyogo, and European centre for disease prevention and control.“This mission underscores the critical importance of partnership and collaboration in health emergencies,” said Dr Jerry-Jonas Mbasha, GOARN focal point at WHO Regional Office for Africa and WHO operational partnerships officer. “GOARN is a vital pillar in the Global Health Emergency Corps, ensuring a coordinated health emergency workforce that is both rooted in countries and connected regionally and globally.”“GOARN brings in targeted expertise to address critical gaps on the ground. With hands-on support and capacity strengthening, we are empowering countries to manage emergencies themselves. While the challenges in DRC remain, our continued mission is to work together, contain the outbreak, and build long-term resilience in the health system,” says Dr Mbasha.As the DRC continues to respond to mpox, joint efforts by national and international partners highlight the importance of collaboration. \"This mission has not only helped us respond to the outbreak but also strengthened the local health system in ways that will last well beyond the end of the current crisis,\" says Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, WHO Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",

        "text_s": "Salima, a mother of four, was severely affected by the floods that hit Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in April 2025. She had previously fled violence and insecurity in the country’s eastern provinces to seek refuge in Kinshasa “A few days after I arrived, the rains caught us by surprise. We lost everything. The entire neighbourhood was heavily flooded. People had to flee to seek refuge elsewhere.”Many of the flood-affected Kinshasa residents were provided with temporary shelter in Kinkole, a neighbourhood in Kinshasa where the government set up a site. More than 100 families were relocated to the shelters. With ambulances mobilized under the World Health Organization's (WHO) SURGE system – a mechanism project for public health emergency preparedness and response – many patients, including pregnant women, were transferred promptly to referral health facilities, ensuring timely and appropriate care.“Less than 24 hours after the disaster, we were on the ground for a rapid assessment of the situation,” said Dr Guy Kalambayi, Emergency Preparedness and Response Officer with WHO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “We helped set up a care unit with the minimum resources needed to relieve the population. Our responsiveness was greatly appreciated by the communities, both in terms of addressing their immediate needs and safeguarding their health.”WHO supported the health authorities to develop public health situation analysis, provide health services to those affected, assess the health needs and provide safe drinking water to the displaced and the households hosting them.By June 2025, more than 5000 people were still living at the Kinkole site, out of the over 10 000 people affected by the floods in the sprawling capital city and its surroundings.Over than two months after the devastating floods that affected at least five major cities in the country, the authorities, supported by WHO and partners, continue to assist those affected to recover from the disaster.In total, about 1.5 million people were affected across the country by the floods, which also damaged more than 200 schools, over 100 health centres, as well as houses and markets. WHO provided essential medical supplies, including emergency medical equipment, to cover the health needs of 10 000 people for three months. WHO also supplied four tents for emergency shelter.“With access to health services disrupted by the disaster, it is critically important to care for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities or chronic conditions who require regular care,” says Dr Kalmbayi.The authorities launched emergency efforts to repair damaged infrastructure and mobilize teams to coordinate humanitarian assistance. In Kinkole and elsewhere, the government and its partners are taking measures to ensure appropriate and dignified living conditions, providing continuity of health services and care, including vaccination and psychosocial support.“We needed safe shelter, water and food. That’s what we received, not to mention the care we received with free medicines,” says Albertine, a medical student in Kinshasa affected by the disaster.For Dr Emilia Sana, Flood Incident Manager at the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare, the coordinated response to the floods “marks a turning point towards a more effective multisectoral framework for our efforts, bringing key ministries together at the highest level.”WHO and partners continue to support the government strengthen outbreak prevention measures, including securing the supply of safe drinking water, sanitation and reinforcing of community-based disease surveillance systems.“We may have lost all our material possessions, but we are still alive and in good health. That's what matters,” says Salima.The Democratic Republic of the Congo remains vulnerable to climate-linked disasters. Off-season rains in June, for instance, claimed at least 29 lives in three districts of Kinshasa, with more than 500 households affected.“One of the key takeaways from this emergency, both in Kinshasa and other provinces, is that there is power in collaboration, particularly in managing potentially epidemic diseases and chronic conditions, thereby ensuring continuity of care. WHO's support through providing medicines to the affected communities has been invaluable,” says Dr Sana of the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare.",

With ambulances mobilized under the World Health Organization's (WHO) SURGE system – a mechanism roject for ublic health emergency rearedness and resonse – many atients, including regnant women, were transferred romtly to referral health facilities, ensuring timely and aroriate care.“Less than 24 hours after the disaster, we were on the ground for a raid assessment of the situation,” said Dr Guy Kalambayi, Emergency Prearedness and Resonse Officer with WHO in the Democratic Reublic of the Congo. “We heled set u a care unit with the minimum resources needed to relieve the oulation. Our resonsiveness was greatly areciated by the communities, both in terms of addressing their immediate needs and safeguarding their health.”WHO suorted the health authorities to develo ublic health situation analysis, rovide health services to those affected, assess the health needs and rovide safe drinking water to the dislaced and the households hosting them.By June 2025, more than 5000 eole were still living at the Kinkole site, out of the over 10 000 eole affected by the floods in the srawling caital city and its surroundings.Over than two months after the devastating floods that affected at least five major cities in the country, the authorities, suorted by WHO and artners, continue to assist those affected to recover from the disaster.In total, about 1.5 million eole were affected across the country by the floods, which also damaged more than 200 schools, over 100 health centres, as well as houses and markets. WHO rovided essential medical sulies, including emergency medical equiment, to cover the health needs of 10 000 eole for three months. WHO also sulied four tents for emergency shelter.“With access to health services disruted by the disaster, it is critically imortant to care for vulnerable grous such as regnant women, children, the elderly and ersons with disabilities or chronic conditions who require regular care,” says Dr Kalmbayi.The authorities launched emergency efforts to reair damaged infrastructure and mobilize teams to coordinate humanitarian assistance. In Kinkole and elsewhere, the government and its artners are taking measures to ensure aroriate and dignified living conditions, roviding continuity of health services and care, including vaccination and sychosocial suort.“We needed safe shelter, water and food. That’s what we received, not to mention the care we received with free medicines,” says Albertine, a medical student in Kinshasa affected by the disaster.For Dr Emilia Sana, Flood Incident Manager at the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare, the coordinated resonse to the floods “marks a turning oint towards a more effective multisectoral framework for our efforts, bringing key ministries together at the highest level.”WHO and artners continue to suort the government strengthen outbreak revention measures, including securing the suly of safe drinking water, sanitation and reinforcing of community-based disease surveillance systems.“We may have lost all our material ossessions, but we are still alive and in good health. That's what matters,” says Salima.The Democratic Reublic of the Congo remains vulnerable to climate-linked disasters. Off-season rains in June, for instance, claimed at least 29 lives in three districts of Kinshasa, with more than 500 households affected.“One of the key takeaways from this emergency, both in Kinshasa and other rovinces, is that there is ower in collaboration, articularly in managing otentially eidemic diseases and chronic conditions, thereby ensuring continuity of care. WHO's suort through roviding medicines to the affected communities has been invaluable,” says Dr Sana of the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Social Welfare."

        "text_s": "To improve access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, including family planning and safe abortions, Zambia is training health workers in values clarification and attitude transformation (VCAT).Adolescents and young people often face barriers when seeking family planning services or safe abortions at health facilities. These barriers can be rooted in stigma and discrimination, which foster disapproval and negative perceptions against people seeking or providing these services.VCAT is a process that helps health workers understand their core values and how those influence their decisions and behaviours. It involves examining one's own beliefs, attitudes and assumptions and using that understanding to make more informed choices and take meaningful action. This process can lead to personal growth, improved decision-making and positive change.“In Zambia, deeply rooted cultural, religious and societal beliefs influence people's views on SRHR, particularly on topics like abortion, contraception, adolescent sexuality and access to services,” says Dr Samson Chisele, Obstetrician-Gynaecologist at Lusaka’s University Teaching Hospital and sexual and reproductive health and rights advocate.These values, attitudes and perceptions can also be held by community health assistants, who provide vital health information and deliver primary health services to communities.To better equip these frontline health providers, the Ministry of Health, with technical and financial support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, organized a four-day VCAT training in March 2025. This initiative brought together 30 participants, including community health assistants and provincial community health focal people from the 10 provinces in Zambia.The primary goal of the training was to address personal biases that act as barriers to essential SRHR services, particularly safe abortion and family planning, including contraception.“During one session, we found that while most community health assistants were comfortable providing contraceptives to married people, they were reluctant to do so for adolescents,” says Dr Chisele, who led the facilitation of the workshop. “VCAT helped them separate personal beliefs from their professional duties, aligning their work with government policy.”The comprehensive training programme provided accurate legal and medical information, addressed stigma and showcased personal stories that humanize young people’s experiences. It emphasized the principles of providing non-judgmental and empathetic care to adolescent girls and young women.Around 760 women in Zambia died during pregnancy or childbirth in 2024, according to the Ministry of Health’s Maternal and Perinatal Data Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) system. An estimated 5.1% of these deaths are attributed to unsafe abortion. This is despite provisions in Zambia’s 1972 Termination of Pregnancy Act: if the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman is at risk, or the health of the foetus is at risk, or under certain socio-economic conditions, abortion is permitted by law.Participants learned how to deliver safe, effective and client-centred abortion care, including comprehensive counselling and appropriate referrals, ultimately encouraging health clients to seek care without fear of misconceptions or stigma.The basic elements of abortion-related counselling encompass pregnancy options, procedure options and ensuring the client's ability to make voluntary, informed choice and provide consent after receiving this information.“My facility has two functioning youth-friendly corners which have helped the community and adolescents to access information, such as family planning methods available, who to get if from and where to find it,” says Hamatanga Gwangai, a health worker from Mululu rural health post in Chibombo, a town in the Central Province of Zambia. “We faced some resistance from parents but after sharing some experiences they agreed to allow their children to access these services.”A key component of the training involved encouraging health workers to reflect on their personal values and societal norms, fostering a deeper understanding of how these can impact care for health clients.“VCAT has helped,” says Helen Mwape, a community health assistant from James Milambo Memorial Health Post in Lufwanyama District, in the country’s central Copperbelt Province.  “I received one adolescent for family planning and after asking where she got the information, she pointed one of the community-based volunteers... so it's working.”Following the training, participants’ primary role is to act as change agents within their communities, orient fellow health workers at their respective facilities and lead open discussions on family planning and abortion. Community health focal people from the Ministry of Health are expected to orient community health assistants in VCAT during their supervisory visits in their assigned provinces.“Following my action plan, I have taken several steps,” says Danny Kasongo from Misenga rural health post in Mansa district of Luapula province, located in the northern part of the country. “I have oriented fellow staff on VCAT, conducted meetings with stakeholders, including the community, engaged community-based volunteers and created an adolescent safe space where sexual and reproductive health issues are discussed and services available.”VCAT represents a cultural shift within Zambia's health system. “WHO is proud to support this initiative,” says Dr Clement Peter Lasuba, WHO Representative in Zambia. “By targeting the root of stigma and empowering health providers, this programme is helping to ensure that no one is turned away or shamed when they seek care.”According to Dr Chisele, VCAT needs to be integrated into health and education systems: nursing and medical schools, teacher training colleges and public service induction programmes. “We also need localized, co-created modules with local leaders and marginalized groups to ensure relevance. Digitizing and modernizing VCAT delivery could attract younger audiences and tech-savvy healthcare workers. In this way we ensure sustainability and longevity to truly transform service delivery,” he says.",
