To support the government-led response, WHO and partners have launched a strategic plan to rapidly contain the outbreak and mitigate its impact on affected communities. The plan outlines response priorities aligned with the five pillars of the WHO Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework: collaborative surveillance, community protection, safe and scalable care, emergency coordination, and access to countermeasures. It also provides a platform to strengthen preparedness capacities and build long-term resilience in the health system, particularly in areas such as water and sanitation, laboratory capacity, and human resources.",

While wild poliovirus transmission has been stopped, and the region is on track to end all active variant type 1 outbreaks by December 2024, variant type 2 outbreaks remain a major challenge. Sustaining political commitment is crucial. Governments are managing competing priorities, unrest and political changes. Effective response also depends on strong coordination across countries and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to sustain engagement and reduce outbreak response delays that are threatening the path to eradication.",
